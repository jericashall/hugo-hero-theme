"Andy and his team replaced an old storm door on a screened-in patio with a full exterior door and storm door. We were making the screened patio into a 3 season room. Andy and his team were very professional and did an excellent job. They cleaned up after themselves and you never knew they were there. Andy even installed a few pieces of lumber framing on the patio that I hadn't got to yet at no extra cost. They go above and beyond to satisfy the customer. We will for sure use Rainey's Property Management in the furture." - Jamie C., Lebanon, OH

"Andy is my neighbor's close friend and co-worker. After seeing him doing so much work for them I inquired about having him do a deck addition for myself. He agreed to do my job during Covid, when supplies were scarce. He didn't stop until he found all the materials needed to complete my job. He's a very hard worker with excellent home improvement skills, and a super friendly person to work with. I definitely would use him again on future home improvements." - Megan C., Lebanon, OH
