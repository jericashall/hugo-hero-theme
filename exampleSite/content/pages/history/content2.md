"Andy and his team replaced an old storm door on a screened-in patio with a full exterior door and storm door. We were making the screened patio into a 3 season room. Andy and his team were very professional and did an excellent job. They cleaned up after themselves and you never knew they were there. Andy even installed a few pieces of lumber framing on the patio that I hadn't got to yet at no extra cost. They go above and beyond to satisfy the customer. We will for sure use Rainey's Property Management in the furture." - Jamie C., Lebanon, OH
