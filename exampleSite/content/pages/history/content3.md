"Andy did work for us a few months ago, and did a wonderful job! He stayed on schedule, and was very reasonable priced. We are very happy with the job, and would recommend him to anyone!" - Angie T., Lebanon, OH

"Andy is my neighbor's close friend and co-worker. After seeing him doing so much work for them I inquired about having him do a deck addition for myself. He agreed to do my job during Covid, when supplies were scarce. He didn't stop until he found all the materials needed to complete my job. He's a very hard worker with excellent home improvement skills, and a super friendly person to work with. I definitely would use him again on future home improvements." - Megan C., Lebanon, OH
